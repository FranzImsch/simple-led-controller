# Simplest LED Controller

![rendering](rendering.png)

Very simple LED controller with an NRF52 as MCU. Controlled via Home Assistant and MySensors using ESB protocol. Basically, it's just a PCB with some MOSFETs, a few resistors and caps as well as a screw terminal.

Only very few advanced components have been used for this project (actually it's just the nRF that is somewhat advanced).
